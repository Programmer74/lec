Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
\\ \hfill Peter H. Salus.

Clarity is better than cleverness.
In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
\\ \hfill Eric S. Raymond.
